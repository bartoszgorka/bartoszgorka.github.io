  GitHub is a top-rated platform for storing code.
  Often, by developing open-source projects, you can meet new people.

  **GitHub offers an excellent opportunity to create our card for everyone visiting our profile.**
  Best of all, **even this card uses a version control system**.

  You must create a **repository that matches your username** to have your own summary.
  The content in the `REAME.md` file in such a repository will also be on the preview of our profile.
  For example, for me, it is the repository: [bartoszgorka](https://github.com/bartoszgorka/bartoszgorka).
