  **Selling is not an easy job.**
  At the same time, the business needs to survive and be profitable.
  Have you ever wondered **why one person succeeds when others have to try and ultimately fail anyway**?

  In this post, I would like to mention the **topic of trust**.
  In my opinion, **it is necessary to be successful in relations** with the team and the customer.

  I know this sounds terrible, but the **customers don't care about you**.
  For them, **the most important thing is that you can solve their problems for which they are willing to pay you**.
  You must understand what your target audience needs and motivates them to buy.
  The last step is to convince them to do business with you.

## Endless Referrals

  ![Endless Referrals by Bob Burg](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51A9QHUKdiL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg){: .align-center .border .max-width-300px}

  The subject of this post is discussed in his book ***Endless Referrals*** by American speaker and author ***Bob Burg***.
  He noticed a principle that can be described as KLT.
  ***It refers to "know, like, and trust".***

  **People often recommend and buy from people they know well, like, and trust.**
  Bob indicates the same in his book.
  We can gain valuable knowledge on how to approach our processes to better interest the customer.

## Projects

  The KLT principle can be applied to the customer.
  **They often go through three stages before a new customer decides to use our services and pay for them.**

### Know

  It would be worthwhile for you to **appear in places where your potential customers are**.
  If you run a blog or create materials, **sometimes it is worth giving something for free**.
  Such an accessory marked with your brand shows you as a professional.
  Often you can promote yourself very well at a low cost.

  Another example is building the image of a good speaker.
  If you want to be invited to conferences, you should try to appear at events for free and build your image.
  I've already written a bit about it in [building personal branding](<{% post_url 2021-09-01-programmers-personal-branding %}>).

  **It is worth collecting the opinions of your customers and their honest reviews.**
  It can come in handy when people don't know you, but people who do know you.

### Like

  **Try to find a common topic with your audience.**
  Talk about things in your company **that people can identify with**.
  Look for **similarities based on which** you can **build a further relationship**.
  Being in the park with a dog, the first topic you will discuss with a stranger may be the topic of dogs.
  Also, in your business, you must rely on what you have in common with your client.

  **Don't try to build the image of a perfect person.**
  Nobody's perfect.
  If you **show that you can perfectly solve your clients' problems** despite some flaws and weaknesses, they will be more willing to cooperate with you.

### Trust

  Above all, **be authentic and real**.
  Represent the values that you identify with, not those currently fashionable.
  Show your customers who you really are.
  **Don't be afraid to give your company an entire personality.**

  **Be consistent in doing so.**
  Establish **specific rules** that guide you in relations with clients and follow them.
  It can set a standard of service that will be equated with you.

  **Let me get to know you and like you as you are.**
  It may allow you to be more successful.
  **Good luck!**
