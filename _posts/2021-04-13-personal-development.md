  I love **podcasts** because they **can change a lot in our lives**.
  Recently I was analyzing [one](https://rozwojosobistydlakazdego.pl/rodk119/), and I would like to share something that seems extremely important to me.

## What is personal development?

  We can achieve development by **drawing conclusions**.
  It's simple!
  But I had a wrong view of it.

  **Personal development is a combination of determination and humility.**
  After a whole week, we should find time to **evaluate what we have learned** and draw conclusions on **what needs improvement**.

  We plan too much what we want to learn, to achieve.
  However, **we think too little about what we are doing**.
  Without an honest assessment of the current activities, it is impossible to go any further.

## Development is not a competition with others

  Instead of the rat race or comparison to others, **we should focus on ourselves**.
  We should **stop and reflect** on our duties, activities, and lives.

  **A successful week consists of what we have achieved and one designated aspect for improvement for the next week.**
