  It's April Fool's Day tomorrow, so IÂ decided to prepare aÂ less technical post.
  IÂ asked my friends who are programmers what annoyed them.
  **Please don't take it asÂ aÂ complaint, but rather asÂ anÂ opportunity to change.**

## Unclear tasks

  The fundamental problem at daily work is theÂ tasks.
  However, not theÂ tasks themselves are theÂ problem, but their **imprecision**.
  You can get aÂ "login" task without any details.
  When we ask stakeholders about their expectations, it turns into much more than we initially expected.

  **Unclear acceptance criteria or reproductive paths** are also aÂ common problem.
  In one ofÂ the companies, weÂ even ranked theÂ worst-described tasks and gave their creators something like *Golden Raspberry Award*.
  It was funny ğŸ˜‚.

## Underestimating tasks

  Most tasks are generally estimated how much they can take.
  Nothing wrong with that.
  While theÂ developer ratings influence theÂ evaluation.

  However, it often turns out that aÂ product manager or other leader has their own evaluation.
  The team can estimate less, but never more than that.
  One ofÂ my friends once showed me how their planning looked like.
  They had anÂ estimation, and theÂ whole team was forced to show that it could be prepared faster.

  Tasks take aÂ long time to start.
  Often theÂ person who valued them did not share why they gave such value.
  Also, theÂ requirements or theÂ environment may have changed.

## Aversion to follow conventions

  Each project is different.
  However, to make it easier to switch between projects or introduce new developers, **most projects follow certain conventions**.
  One ofÂ the things that can be annoying is theÂ person in theÂ team who always does his own thing, in his own way.

  The same problem is when there is aÂ "guru" in theÂ team who accepts every change.
  Of course, only (s)he has aÂ monopoly on theÂ right decisions and good ideas.

## Ignoring team feedback

  A team working daily with aÂ project can understand its limitations much better than someone from theÂ outside.
  **There is probably nothing more upset than ignoring theÂ team's voice.**
  In theÂ case ofÂ critical errors, this can have anÂ objectionable effect.

  Adding tasks to your team (without consulting) and expecting immediate execution can also be frustrating.
  During one ofÂ the sprints, IÂ had such aÂ situation.
  IÂ received assignments at theÂ speed ofÂ aÂ machine gun, each subsequent one even more critical.
  In theÂ end, nothing was ready, and theÂ sprint was wasted.

## Poor value meetings

  Depending on your position and experience, you can attend meetings or aÂ large number ofÂ meetings.
  You often have to be because, asÂ aÂ leader, you are responsible for specific functionalities.
  **How easy is it to annoy aÂ programmer?**
  Exactly!
  Schedule aÂ meeting that could be solved by collaborating on theÂ document.

  In theÂ [productivity post]({% post_url 2021-03-24-be-more-productive-when-working-remotely %}), IÂ indicated theÂ calendar topic.
  Blocking hours may be theÂ only opportunity to be able to work and deliver value that others expect.
  Many thanks to Piotr for theÂ suggestion.

## Strange recruitment offers

  Finally, IÂ left aÂ topic which can be anÂ IT legend.
  Some ofÂ the offers you can receive on LinkedIn are sent by scripts.
  A funny situation happened once.
  A colleague uses anÂ emoji asÂ aÂ first name and first name + last name in theÂ last name field.
  One ofÂ the recruiters just greeted him using emoji instead ofÂ name!

## Summary

  You might think that programmers are special people, and their uniqueness blinds them.
  Nothing could be more wrong.
  **A software developer is aÂ person like any other.**
  Daily work, however, provides many situations to upset, surprise, and even laugh.
  The most important thing is to **remain human and be able to cope with theÂ world around us**.
