  The New Year is an occasion for new resolutions.
  **Most often, they are only for a while.**
  We gradually lose commitment and eventually (after two weeks, less or more) stop altogether.

  **What influences our resignation?**
  What should we do to **increase our loyalty**?

## The key: Environment

  **The environment should support our development.**
  If the conditions are not favorable, we will achieve nothing.

  Suppose we want to read more books.
  How can we achieve it?
  **It is illusory to expect it to work out somehow.**
  The best way is to leave the book by the bedside.
  We can read a moment after waking up and a moment before going to bed.
  Even ten pages a day is as much as ten pages more than when we start the resolution without our conscious support.

  The same is true when we are using a standing desk.
  If we have to lift it manually, we will often not feel like doing it.
  I also had this problem.
  It can be solved by using mechanical lifting or setting a reminder on the computer.
  There is time to sit and then a standing session.
  Both positions are not healthy for the body, so it is worth changing them regularly.

### Build associations with an activity

  The example with the book shows the **power of building links between place and activities.**
  **These mental associations support our decisions.**

  I wanted to introduce more activity into my daily routine.
  To be more motivated, I decided to do simple physical exercises every time I brush my teeth.
  The simple combination made the body start exercising itself as soon as I finished brushing my teeth.

## Summary

  **The environment should support our development.**
  Building associations between place and activities can mentally support our decisions.
