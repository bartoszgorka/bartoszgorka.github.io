  Knowledge sharing can be a great way to grow faster.
  To convey the content well, it is first necessary to understand it.
  The sooner we start documenting our progress, the less risk of impostor syndrome.

## Become an expert

  Knowledge sharing is also an excellent opportunity to **build the image of an expert**.
  Suppose a given topic is well known to us, and we solve the problems of others.
  In that case, there is a high probability that we will be associated with that topic and be recognized as experts.
  This can be our motivation to develop further.

  **Strong position and experience can also be used as a way to do business.**
  By introducing a course, training, or other paid forms of knowledge transfer, we can benefit from our experience and position.

  In the IT world, most knowledge can be accessed for free.
  However, then **we pay our time to find, analyze and test the solutions**.
  Free materials allow you to get acquainted with the topic at the expense of your time.
  In paid, however, we usually receive processed information.
  Depending on our approach, we can freely choose between the forms.

## Attend conferences

  Knowledge sharing can have other benefits as well.
  One of the most important may be the fact of **being invited to conferences as a speaker**.
  Often, these are paid conferences, but we get free participation and get a place to promote ourselves and our creativity.

  Attending meetups and conferences can be an enjoyable experience.
  It is a **great opportunity to meet new people**.
  They are often people who can inspire or motivate us to act.

  It may be a good idea to **start with mentoring and speaking within the company**.
  Then we are dealing with a larger group of recipients, but still people we know pretty well.
  Once we breakthrough, we can try more comprehensively.

## Don't be afraid

  Many people are afraid to share knowledge to avoid criticism.
  It doesn't quite make sense.
  **There are certainly people who have a different opinion than ours.**
  It can be wonderful.
  Suppose these people can communicate their concerns and indicate why they disagree with us.
  In that case, it allows us to develop more dynamically.

  Each of us started from scratch.
  Every day new people enter the IT world.
  **It is worth breaking your reluctance against not understanding and thinking that no one will be interested in it.**
  There will always be someone for whom this will be new information.
  We, on the other hand, can overcome our limitations and fears.

  You don't need to have an extensive plan for your action.
  **The most important thing is to start.**
  It goes on and on by itself.
  Especially if you enjoy what you do.

  In my case, the blog was supposed to be a place where I could share my thoughts.
  It was also a way to break through to share knowledge publicly.
  Thank you for taking a moment to read what I am writing about.

## Summary

  Don't be afraid to experiment with the form of knowledge transfer.
  For some, running a blog will be a dream come true.
  Others may choose to host a podcast or YouTube channel.

  It is important to **start and not be afraid of criticism.**
  There will always be someone we can help.
  **Our knowledge can be helpful** and a huge step in personal development.
