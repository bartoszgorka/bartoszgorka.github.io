**Layoffs have accelerated significantly this year.**
Generally, I discuss projects, management, and programming topics on the blog.
This time, however, I would like to focus on a topic that has touched or will soon touch us.

Using the website [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/) **we can see how this trend has intensified in recent months**.
Below is a chart that makes it very clear what we are dealing with now.

In talks with the team, the topic of **layoffs related to the recession on the market** also came up.
This is a significant uncertainty for employees.
In addition, **applying for new positions can be significantly more difficult**.
The following graphic also appeared in our conversations (Source: Visual Capitalist).

### The scale of layoffs

Using the presented sources, the **largest technology companies like Meta, Amazon, and Booking are reducing their teams**.
These layoffs affect the entire tech industry.
**The phenomenon itself is definitely global.**
The same problems can be observed both in the USA and in Europe.

### Method of realization of layoffs

Because of what I present here, I may end up on someone's blocked list.

There is no denying that **employees' salaries are one of the most important items in the company's budget**.
The larger the team, the more you need to guarantee a sufficiently high income to cover all the company's expenses.

**By reducing the team, cash flow can be improved.**
In addition, the company may survive another month or two thanks to this.

**However, I think a reduction can be made in stages throughout the year.**
It is a much better approach than eliminating thousands of workers all at once and reducing employment by 30 to 50 percent.
**Keeping track of the company's financial situation** on an ongoing basis **is also an opportunity to react faster to changes**.
I have written many times about the importance of change and adaptation, so I refer you to [this post](<{% post_url 2021-03-10-the-most-important-thing-in-the-project %}>).
**Instead of waiting for the quarterly summary, monthly results already allow you to build a picture of what is happening in the company and its environment.**
