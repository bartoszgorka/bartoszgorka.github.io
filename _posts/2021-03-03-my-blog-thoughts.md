  Thank you for being there and reading what I am creating for you.
  It's been a while since my first post.
  I have thought about starting blogging for a long time.

  **A blog is a great way to learn from your past.**
  **You can be your own teacher.**
  Let me show you why I started my blog.

## English language

  The choice of language was **one of the more difficult decisions at the beginning**.
  **I opted for the English version.**
  Even though I am not a native speaker.
  I realize that sometimes I will have a grammar problem or my posts contain errors.
  I am sorry for that.
  Each post allows me to learn and reduce incomprehension.
  **Small changes that will make me better with each post**.

  The English version also has other advantages.
  Due to the prevalence of this language, **more people can understand us**.
  Compare the percentage of your national language speakers to the number of potential readers.
  Instead of in your mother tongue, **you should write in English immediately**.

  **You may be as scared** as I was at the beginning.
  But I will surprise you!
  **Most of your audience is also non-native speakers**.
  There are around 450 million native speakers in the world, while **even five times more are non-native speakers**!
  Creating easy-to-understand content is better than making fanciful grammar forms.

## Avoid your own platform

  At the very beginning, I spent a long time thinking about the platform.
  You can choose from many options: self-hosted Wordpress[^wordpress], WordPress as a Service[^wpaas], own created CMS[^cms], or hundreds of other solutions.

  My advice is: **use a ready-made platform, not your own**.
  I opted for **GitHub Pages**[^gp].
  A simple solution that **allows you to focus on content delivery.**
  I will try to prepare more details in one of the next posts.
  With technical details to help you start!

  [^gp]: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Reduce fears - you're breathtaking

  For a long time, I was afraid that nobody would want to read what I prepared.
  I still feel it, but now I approach it differently.
  **Instead of trying to impress someone, I see this blog as my own place.**
  I am writing to **share my knowledge, experience, and thoughts**.

  This blog is to **support my mission** of making the world a better place.
  Thanks to the comments, I feel an even greater need to create.
  **Thanks for every comment and share in social media.**

  **Let us not be afraid of opinions and criticism.**
  This allows you fast personal development.
  It is also a **motivation to fill gaps in knowledge** or change our thinking.

## Just write

  When I decided to prepare the first entries, it took hours.
  I didn't know how to start or what to say.
  Like most, I was afraid I had nothing to write about.

  Remember that you can always write about something already well-known.
  Everyone understands the world differently.
  You organized your knowledge to understand a specific topic.
  Please share it with others.
  You can help someone.

  **It's good to have a schedule** for future entries.
  **Systematic publication** is useful for the recipient.
  It is better than ten posts appearing once and then nothing.
  The Internet is full of blogs that have 1-2 entries, blogs that have been abandoned.

  That's why **I decided to publish every Wednesday.**
  Sometimes there will be additional entries (such as the [TIL](http://localhost:4000/tags/#til) series).

## Summary

  **You have to give yourself time to reach your audience.**
  This also applies to me.
  Writing at first can be difficult.
  It's much easier later.
  **Rome wasn't built in a day.**
