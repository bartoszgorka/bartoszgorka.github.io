  Do you know this device?
  I think each of us has had contact with him.
  It is especially possible if you have been hospitalized.

  **Have you ever wondered how a pulse oximeter works?**
  It puzzled me a lot, so I decided to prepare a little explanation for you.

## Principle of operation

  **A pulse oximeter is a device for measuring blood saturation.**
  Blood saturation itself refers to the amount of hemoglobin (contained in red blood cells in our blood) bound to oxygen at any given time to unbound hemoglobin.
  **It doesn't sound very easy, but it's just about how much oxygen our blood contains.**

  The principle of operation of the **pulse oximeter is based on the absorption of radiation by red cells of red light (660 nanometers) and infrared light (940 nanometers)**.
  The degree of wave absorption by hemoglobin depends on whether it is transporting oxygen or not.
  The result is calibrated in the device and given as a percentage.
  Saturation with a pulse oximeter in adults is usually measured on the fingertip or ear lobe.
  In newborns, oxygen saturation is measured using a pulse oximeter on the wrist or foot.

## The research results

  **The oxygenation level of hemoglobin with oxygen at the level of 95% to 100% is considered a correct result.**
  The measurement itself is done in a **non-invasive manner**.
  Be aware that the presence of nail varnish or artificial nails may interfere with proper pulse oximeter readings.
  The patient's movement during the examination also affects the inaccurate result.

## Hypoxia

  **Often, hypoxia is invisible, and the patient shows no symptoms.**
  Hypoxia is a life-threatening condition.
  **That is why it is important to monitor vital signs** (measuring saturation is one of them), especially in the hospital.
