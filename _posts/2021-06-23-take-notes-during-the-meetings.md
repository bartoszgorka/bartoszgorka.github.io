  Some of our meetings are not perfect.
  The plan is often missing.
  After leaving the meeting, it is unclear what the purpose was and what has become established.
  **Meetings often don't go as we would expect.**

  You have two options in your situation.
  **You can do so far or try a new approach to meetings.**
  I suggest one simple change: **take notes during the meeting**.

  You may find that you are more involved and have a better understanding of the topic at hand.
  It's important to understand the topic first, to make a good summary.
  **It forces effective participation in the meeting and following the discussion.**

## Benefits

  There should no longer be situations when nobody knows what to do after leaving a meeting.
  Remember to not rely on your brain only.
  It won't remember everything anyway.

  **A good summary can be used as project progress documentation.**
  It can provide introductory material for new team members.
  Notes can also be a **source of truth and a good reference** while working.

  Don't be afraid to make your notes public.
  **Instead of making notes just for yourself, keep it as a summary of your meetings.**
  If something is not quite as you summarized, the team can help you to change it.

  Another benefit can be a reference if someone is unable to attend the meeting.
  Often, during a vacation or illness, critical decisions about our work were made without us, and we were not even notified.
  **Meeting notes and summaries can promote transparency in the company.**

## On paper or digitally

  There are **two ways** to create such summaries.
  You can start with **notes on a piece of paper and later digitize it**.
  The second way is to create a **digital version right away**.

  Prepare an experiment and choose your own method based on your predispositions and habits.
  I prefer small **sticky notes** and handwritten notes.
  I note the main keys and a short comment on them.
  Immediately after the meeting, I'm starting to prepare a full summary.

  This form allows me to focus more on the topic.
  While creating on the computer, I had the impression of being a clerk.
  I just wrote down what was indicated instead of participating in the discussion.

## Summary

  **Taking notes and summaries of meetings can provide a better engagement in discussions.**
  Share your notes as a team summary.
  Don't be afraid of inaccuracies or mistakes.
  Thanks to the support of others, you can correct mistakes.
  Find your way to summarize.
