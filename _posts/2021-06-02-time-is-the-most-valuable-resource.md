  Time can be the best gift our loved ones can receive.
  It’s you who gets to live your one and only life.
  Don’t let people who won’t ever live with the consequences of your choices determine how you spend your time.

  It is said that money is the most important thing.
  In my opinion, they are necessary, but there is an even more valuable resource.

  That resource is time.
  **Time is the most valuable resource we have.**
  Each of us has the same amount of time.
  The only difference is the way it is managed.
  **Each day is 86400 seconds that won't repeat itself.**

  Time cannot be bought, although you can outsource certain activities.
  **We often sell our time and skills to our employers**, receiving a financial remuneration in return.

#### The greatest gift
  **Time can be the best gift our loved ones can receive.**
  Instead of fancy gifts, sometimes a **moment together can be much more valuable**.

  Let's learn to manage our time well because it still flows.
  Let's draw conclusions based on yesterday so that the next day is even better than all the previous ones.

## Summary

  It’s **you** who gets to live **your one and only life**.
  Don’t let people who won’t ever live with the consequences of your choices determine how you spend your time.
