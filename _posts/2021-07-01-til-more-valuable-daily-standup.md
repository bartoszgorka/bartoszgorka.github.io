title: "TIL: More valuable daily standup"
excerpt: >-
  At the meeting, we should not say which task we are doing.
  We should focus on what we have already done and what we plan to do.
  A slight shift in our view of status can make us more focused on delivering value.

  Daily standup or daily scrum is the term for a daily team meeting.
  Its purpose is to share knowledge about the work performed and to identify problems.

  **The meeting should be short and as concise as possible.**
  We want to be completely focused and eliminate distractions.

  Each team member should indicate the following topics in a **short speech**:
  - What did I do yesterday?
  - What will I do today?
  - Do I see any blockers?

  All questions are related to our work in the context of meeting the Sprint Goal.

  **You have to be careful because only a fine line separates these questions and daily from regular reporting (status to the manager / our confession).**

## TIL: focus on specific, not general, tasks

  Instead of focusing on the task that I was doing, it is worth focusing on the already prepared elements.
  For example, instead of saying _"I'm working on bug X_", it is worth mentioning to _"I replicated it, but not fixed yet"_.

  At the meeting, **we should not say which task we are doing**.
  We should **focus on what we have already done and what we plan to do**.
  A slight shift in our view of status can make us more focused on delivering value.
