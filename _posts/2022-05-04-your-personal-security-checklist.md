  Recently, I have been exploring areas related to security quite a lot, both in technical and personal matters.
  **I want to share a [great list](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist) with over 300 different tips on protecting digital security and privacy.**

  Many things seem obvious.
  However, I really liked the clear presentation of the topic's priority, details, and hints.
  **It allows you to see alternatives and understand** why a given issue was considered, for example, as recommended.

### Authentication

  **Using strong passwords is a basic step to being more secure.**
  Using strong, unique passwords for each system in pair with a good password manager will significantly reduce the risk of a brute-force attack or based on disclosed passwords.
  If you are creating a system, visit the post [Check your password security with Have I Been Pwned?](<{% post_url 2022-02-09-check_your_password_security_with_have_i_been_pwned %}>).
  **I discussed how you could check for leaks to offer additional security for your clients.**

  **Enable 2-Factor Authentication is also a very important security feature.**
  Most often, support for OTP generated in the application will be offered.
  Still, sometimes even more secure physical authentication keys (FIDO U2F) can be used.
  It is worth **saving the Backup Codes** or **registering more than one device** to avoid losing access to the system if there is a failure or loss of a 2FA device.

  Be careful with any devices you connect to your computer.
  **If you found a USB somewhere, avoid plugging it.**
  You never know what might be on it, and it could be a Fork Bomb attack or some keyloggers.

  The same goes for phone calls.
  Charging via some USB cable in public places, such as a cafe, can end badly.
  It's better to use your charger connected directly to the power.

### Web browser

  Working professionally, the web browser is often an indispensable tool throughout the working day.
  It is also the first line of defense against dangerous websites.
  After working for a long time, **I started using Brave**.
  It is an **excellent combination of the best features offered by Chrome and Firefox**.
  At the same time, security and data protection are strengthened.
  I recommend this browser to you too!

  It would be worthwhile to block ads.
  In Brave, you have a lot of automatic blockers.
  However, **good Adblock is still recommended**.
  Also, remember to reduce the number of extensions to the necessary minimum.
  Each extension is a potential danger, so it is worth minimizing the risk.

  **My friends also use Virtual Machine to open all downloaded files in Sandbox mode.**
  You should consider it as an added security feature when receiving multiple potentially dangerous attachments.

### Other recommendations

  The [list](https://github.com/Lissy93/personal-security-checklist) contains many useful recommendations.
  I only covered the first two chapters by pointing out what it looks like in my life.
  **You do not need to implement all the recommendations, but you should at least read them.**
  Sometimes a tiny change in your daily habits can be of great benefit.

  **If your friends ask how to keep private data safe, don't be afraid to recommend this list to them.**
  Maybe this will make us all a little more resistant to attacks.
